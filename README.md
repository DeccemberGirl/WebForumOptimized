<h2>Our project is alredy here, but still does not work properly - we are working hard to correct it as soon as possible.</h2>

<h3>So, DAL is almost ready, only small fixes are needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>rename parameters to clarify its purpose: for ex. id -> topicId;</li>
<li>move constants to a separate class;</li>
<li>add unit tests where needed;</li>
</ul>
